	<p>Carrots
Carrots are full of phytochemicals, such as beta-carotene, that your body converts to vitamin A, which helps with vision — especially at night. Studies also associate consumption of carotenoid-containing foods, like carrots, with a decreased risk of breast cancer. Carrots contain vitamins K and C, as well as potassium. The fiber contents of carrots can also help you meet your daily fiber needs.

When it comes to flavor and texture, carrots can add crunch, flavor and vibrant color to your meals and snacks. Add shredded or sautéed carrots to marinara sauce or enjoy these root veggies raw, shredded in salads, or blended in a healthy smoothie.
